login page is meant for those where everything
is already set up ready to go

register clan page is meant for someone without 
an account who is creating their account as well
as tying it to their clan , thus getting 
chieftain privilage

need a page in the case the chieftain has already
created the clan, and you register an account 
which also ties you to that clan 

one account can never be in a different clan
or apply to be in a different clans timers


TLDR

login = good to go
register clan = also create chieftains account
need account? = must register to a clan

if you want your own solo timers, just make
a fake clan and be the chief
